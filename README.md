# Digram
<!-- ## Overview -->
Digram is a dApp that aims to enhance web2 information-sharing approaches through the use of tokenised consensus mechanisms. 

Digram uses a custom ERC20 token to provide incentives to answer community questions.
In addition to incentivised answering, Digram features a quadratic staking protocol to improve answer quality through the use of gamified voting which again improves on web2 solutions, allowing users to be paid for providing answer feedback. 

Finally, Digram improves upon web2 alternatives by utilising decentralised data composable storage protocols through Ceramic and IPFS.
